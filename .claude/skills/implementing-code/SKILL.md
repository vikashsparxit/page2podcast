# Code Implementation

**Mindset:** Build working software that solves the problem. The plan is a guide, not a contract.

## Goal

Implement all phases and create working, tested code that meets the acceptance criteria.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read the Plan

Read `PLAN.md` and understand:
- Total number of phases
- Scope boundaries
- Acceptance criteria

**Count phases explicitly:** "I see {N} phases in the plan. I will implement all {N}."

**Pattern Discovery (if retrieval available):** If `search_code` tool is available, query it to find similar implementations or related test files before starting each phase. This helps discover existing patterns to follow and dependencies to account for. Skip if not configured.

**Impact Analysis (if dependency graph available):** If the research phase built a dependency graph (visible in RESEARCH.md's "Key Dependencies" section), use it to identify callers and downstream consumers of files you're modifying. This helps catch unintended breakage.

### Step 2: Implement Phase by Phase

For each phase:
1. Mark phase as in-progress in STATUS.md
2. Implement all tasks
3. Write/update tests
4. **Run phase validation from PLAN.md** (if defined)
5. Verify all phase validation checks pass
6. Mark phase complete

**CRITICAL: Before marking a phase complete, run the Validation checklist from PLAN.md.**

Example validation from plan:
```markdown
Validation:
- [ ] npm test passes
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] New class is importable
```

The implementer MUST verify these before proceeding.

**Continue until ALL phases are done.**

### Step 3: Deviate Wisely

Good reasons to deviate:
- Discovered a better approach
- Plan conflicts with existing architecture
- External dependencies changed
- Security/performance issues found

When deviating:
- Document in IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Explain WHY
- Ensure tests still pass

### Step 4: Run Full Validation

After all phases:
- Run full test suite
- Run type check (if TypeScript)
- Run lint
- Run build

### Step 5: Create IMPLEMENTATION.md and Update STATUS.md

Write `docs/{issue_name}/IMPLEMENTATION.md` and update `docs/{issue_name}/STATUS.md`.

## Autonomy Rules

- **Implement ALL phases** - don't stop after Phase 1
- **The plan guides, not dictates** - better approaches are welcome
- **Document deviations** - explain why you diverged
- **Tests are required** - part of each phase, not after

## Output Format

```markdown
# Implementation: {issue_name}

**What:** {feature_description}
**When:** {timestamp}

---

## Summary

Built {brief description of what was implemented}.
{N}/{N} phases completed.

---

## Changes

### Files Created
- `path/to/file.ts` - {purpose}

### Files Modified
- `path/to/file.ts` - {what changed}

---

## Phases Completed

- [x] Phase 1: {name} - {brief result}
- [x] Phase 2: {name} - {brief result}

---

## Test Results

- Tests: {N} total, {N} passing
- Coverage: {X}% for new code
- Type check: pass/fail
- Lint: pass/fail
- Build: pass/fail

---

## Deviations from Plan

{None | List deviations with reasons}

| Plan Said | What We Did | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| {original} | {actual} | {reason} |

---

## Known Limitations

- {limitation} (impact: {low/medium})
```

## Quality Check

- [ ] Queried for related files (if retrieval available)?
- [ ] Read PLAN.md and counted phases?
- [ ] Implemented ALL phases?
- [ ] Ran validation for EACH phase from PLAN.md?
- [ ] All phase validations pass?
- [ ] Tests written and passing?
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified?
- [ ] Deviations documented?
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION.md created?
- [ ] STATUS.md updated?

## Common Issues

- **Stopping early:** Don't stop after Phase 1. Implement ALL phases from PLAN.md.
- **Skipping tests:** Tests are part of each phase, not a final step.
- **Ignoring validation:** Run the validation checklist from PLAN.md for each phase before proceeding.
- **Over-engineering:** Don't add unrequested features. Build what the plan specifies.
- **Silent failures:** If ANY phase is incomplete OR any validation fails, keep implementing.
