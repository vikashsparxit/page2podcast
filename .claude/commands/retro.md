## Phase 10: Retrospective & Knowledge Capture

You are entering the **Retro** phase for issue: `$ARGUMENTS`

### Pre-Conditions
- Read `00_STATUS.md` — review the entire journey
- Read all artifacts in `.claude/planning/$ARGUMENTS/`
- Read `.claude/LEARNINGS.md` for current learnings

### Instructions

Capture lessons learned and improve future workflows. Create `.claude/planning/$ARGUMENTS/11_RETROSPECTIVE.md` AND update the project's `CLAUDE.md`.

#### 1. `11_RETROSPECTIVE.md`

```markdown
# Retrospective: {issue-name}

## Summary
- **Started:** {date}
- **Completed:** {date}
- **Complexity:** {actual vs estimated}
- **Files Changed:** {count}
- **Tests Added:** {count}
- **Phases Completed:** {N}/10

## What Went Well
- ...
- ...

## What Could Be Improved
- ...
- ...

## Surprises / Unknowns Encountered
- ...
- ...

## Key Technical Learnings
- Learning 1: {specific, actionable insight}
- Learning 2: ...

## Process Learnings
- Were any phases unnecessary for this type of change?
- Were any phases missing or insufficient?
- What would you do differently next time?

## Patterns to Reuse
- Pattern: {description}
  - Where: {context}
  - Why: {benefit}

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Anti-pattern: {description}
  - Why: {consequence}
  - Instead: {better approach}

## Metrics
- Estimation accuracy: {estimated vs actual effort}
- Test coverage delta: {before vs after}
- Review iterations: {count}
- Security findings: {count and severity}
```

#### 2. Update Learnings

Append **specific, actionable learnings** to TWO files:

**a) `.claude/LEARNINGS.md`** — Full learnings with detail (the canonical store):
```markdown
### {date} — {issue-name}
- **{Bold summary}.** {Detail and context}
- **{Bold summary}.** {Detail and context}
```

**b) Project root `CLAUDE.md`** — Abbreviated learnings (keep only the 2 most recent retro blocks; move older ones to `.claude/LEARNINGS.md` only). Use one-line summaries without full detail to minimize token cost.

**Good learnings:**
- `2026-02-21: Always use parameterized queries for user input in the reports module (add-report-export)`
- `2026-02-21: WebSocket reconnection needs exponential backoff with jitter (add-realtime-collab)`

**Bad learnings (too vague):**
- `Write good tests` (not actionable)
- `Be careful with security` (not specific)

#### 3. Update Auto-Memory (Project-Personal Knowledge)

After updating CLAUDE.md, also persist learnings to the auto-memory directory for cross-session context. The auto-memory directory is at `~/.claude/projects/{project-hash}/memory/`.

**Append to `memory/learnings.md`:**
```markdown
## {date} — {issue-name}
- {specific, actionable learning from this retro}
- {specific, actionable learning from this retro}
```

**Update `memory/MEMORY.md` Session Notes section** — add a one-line entry:
```markdown
- {date}: {brief summary of issue and key outcome}
```
If MEMORY.md Session Notes section exceeds ~150 lines, prune the oldest entries to stay under 200 lines total.

**If new stable patterns were confirmed**, append to `memory/patterns.md`:
```markdown
## Pattern: {name}
- **Context:** {when this applies}
- **Solution:** {what to do}
- **Confirmed:** {date, issue name}
```

**If new architectural decisions were made**, append to `memory/decisions.md`:
```markdown
## Decision: {title}
- **Date:** {date}
- **Context:** {why}
- **Decision:** {what}
- **Status:** Active
```

#### 4. Update `00_STATUS.md`

Mark ALL phases as complete:

```markdown
## Progress
- [x] Discovery - Completed
- [x] Research - Completed
- [x] Design - Completed
- [x] Planning - Completed
- [x] Implementation - Completed
- [x] Review - Completed ✓ APPROVED
- [x] Security - Completed ✓ PASSED
- [x] Deploy - Completed (planned)
- [x] Observe - Completed (configured)
- [x] Retro - Completed

## Status: ✅ WORKFLOW COMPLETE
```

### Post-Actions
- Update `00_STATUS.md`: mark Retro as completed, set status to WORKFLOW COMPLETE
- Append full learnings to `.claude/LEARNINGS.md`
- Update `CLAUDE.md` with abbreviated learnings (keep only 2 most recent retro blocks)
- Summarize the entire workflow journey to the user
- Suggest: commit, push, and deploy

### Quality Gates
- Retrospective covers all sections (not just "it went fine")
- At least 2 learnings added to `.claude/LEARNINGS.md`
- Abbreviated learnings added to `CLAUDE.md` (max 2 recent blocks)
- Learnings are specific and reference the issue name
- Process learnings address whether phase selection was appropriate
- Auto-memory updated (learnings.md + MEMORY.md Session Notes at minimum)
- 00_STATUS.md shows complete journey
