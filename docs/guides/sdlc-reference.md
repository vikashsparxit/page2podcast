# SDLC Extended — Command Reference

Quick reference for all slash commands in the Extended SDLC workflow.

## Core Workflow (10 Phases)

### `/discover [feature description]`
**Phase 1** — Scope and define a new feature or fix.
- Generates kebab-case issue name
- Creates 01_DISCOVERY.md with problem statement, success criteria, scope
- Initializes 00_STATUS.md with all 10 phases
- **Next:** `/research {issue}`

### `/research {issue-name}`
**Phase 2** — Deep codebase and ecosystem analysis.
- Analyzes relevant files, patterns, dependencies
- Identifies integration points and risks
- Produces technical recommendations
- **Next:** `/design-system {issue}`

### `/design-system {issue-name}`
**Phase 3** — Architecture and system design.
- Creates 03_ARCHITECTURE.md with component design, data model, API design
- Generates ADR (Architecture Decision Record) for each key decision
- Produces 03_PROJECT_SPEC.md with technical and non-functional requirements
- **Next:** `/plan {issue}`

### `/plan {issue-name}`
**Phase 4** — Detailed implementation planning.
- Breaks work into small, testable phases
- Each phase has tasks, tests, acceptance criteria, and rollback
- Includes overall test strategy
- **Next:** `/implement {issue}`

### `/implement {issue-name}`
**Phase 5** — Phase-by-phase code implementation.
- Follows 04_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md exactly
- Test-driven: write test → implement → verify
- Updates 00_STATUS.md with progress per phase
- **Next:** `/review {issue}`

### `/review {issue-name}`
**Phase 6** — Comprehensive code review.
- Runs all automated checks (lint, types, tests, build)
- Manual review against checklist (security, patterns, naming, tests)
- Produces 06_CODE_REVIEW.md with categorized findings
- **Next:** `/security {issue}` (if approved)

### `/security {issue-name}`
**Phase 7** — Security audit.
- STRIDE threat modeling
- OWASP Top 10 checklist
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Data privacy review
- **Next:** `/deploy-plan {issue}` (if passed)

### `/deploy-plan {issue-name}`
**Phase 8** — Deployment strategy.
- Pre-deployment checklist
- Rollout strategy (canary, blue-green, feature flag, etc.)
- Rollback playbook with specific triggers and steps
- Post-deployment verification plan
- **Next:** `/observe {issue}`

### `/observe {issue-name}`
**Phase 9** — Observability setup.
- RED/USE metrics definition
- Structured logging events
- Alerting rules with actions
- Dashboard specification
- SLI/SLO definitions
- **Next:** `/retro {issue}`

### `/retro {issue-name}`
**Phase 10** — Retrospective and knowledge capture.
- Documents what went well, what to improve
- Captures technical and process learnings
- Updates CLAUDE.md with actionable insights
- Marks workflow as COMPLETE

### `/sdlc/continue`
Resume an incomplete workflow automatically.
- Scans `.claude/planning/` for incomplete `00_STATUS.md` files
- If one found, auto-selects it; if multiple, asks you to choose
- Determines the next phase and invokes the appropriate command
- Supports both new (`00_STATUS.md`) and legacy (`STATUS.md`) naming

### `/perf-test {issue-name}`
Performance testing and benchmarking. Baseline capture, load testing, profiling, frontend performance (Lighthouse/Core Web Vitals). Use after Implementation.

### `/hotfix [description]`
Compressed 4-step emergency workflow: Assess → Fix → Review → Deploy Notes. For production incidents only. Creates `hotfix-` prefixed issues.

### `/typescript-pro [description]`
TypeScript expert mode. Applies advanced type system patterns, branded types, discriminated unions, Result types, exhaustive checks. For complex TypeScript challenges.

### `/devops/ci-pipeline [context]`
Generate production-ready CI/CD pipeline configuration. Auto-detects stack. Outputs GitHub Actions or GitLab CI with lint → test → build → security → deploy stages.
